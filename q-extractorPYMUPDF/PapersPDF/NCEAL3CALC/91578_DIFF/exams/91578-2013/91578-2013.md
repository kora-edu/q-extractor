(e) A spherical balloon is being inflated with helium. 

The balloon is being inflated in such a way that its volume is increasing at a constant rate of 300 cm3 s–1. 

The material that the balloon is made of is of limited strength, and the balloon will burst when its surface area reaches 7500 cm2.

Find the rate at which the surface area of the balloon is increasing when it reaches bursting point.
