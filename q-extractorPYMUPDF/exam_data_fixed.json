    "answer": "To solve the differential equation \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv^2 \\), we separate variables:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dv}{v^2} = -k \\, dt\n\\]\n\nIntegrating both sides, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dv}{v^2} = \\int -k \\, dt\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{v} = -kt + C\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = kt + C\n\\]\n\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), the initial velocity is \\( v = u \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{u} = C\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = kt + \\frac{1}{u}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{1}{kt + \\frac{1}{u}}\n\\]\n\nAfter one second (\\( t = 1 \\)), the velocity is:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{u}} = \\frac{1}{k + \\frac{1}{u}} = \\frac{u}{ku + 1}\n\\]"

    "query": "(ii) The temperature of the coffee when it is poured is 65°C. After 2 minutes, its temperature is 62°C. Ben can drink the coffee when its temperature is 54°C.\n\nSolve the differential equation from part (i) to find how long from when it was poured, Ben has to wait before he can first drink the coffee.",
    "type": "NCEA",
    "answer": "The provided answer seems to be unrelated to the question about the coffee cooling. To solve this problem, we need to use Newton's Law of Cooling, which is typically expressed as:\n\ndT/dt = -k(T - T_env)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the coffee, T_env is the ambient temperature, and k is a positive constant.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial temperature, T(0) = 65°C\n- Temperature after 2 minutes, T(2) = 62°C\n- Drinkable temperature, T = 54°C\n\nAssuming the ambient temperature (T_env) is constant, we can solve the differential equation to find the time when the coffee reaches 54°C.\n\n1. Integrate the differential equation to find T(t).\n2. Use the given conditions to find the constant k.\n3. Solve for the time when T(t) = 54°C.\n\nHowever, without the ambient temperature, we cannot provide a specific solution. Please provide the ambient temperature to proceed with the calculation."
