    "answer": "To find the area enclosed between the graph of \\(y = \\sin(2x)\\), the x-axis, and the lines \\(x = \\pi/6\\) and \\(x = \\pi/3\\), we need to evaluate the definite integral of \\(|\\sin(2x)|\\) from \\(\\pi/6\\) to \\(\\pi/3\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sin(2x)\\) is positive in this interval, we can integrate \\(\\sin(2x)\\) directly:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{\\pi/6}^{\\pi/3} \\sin(2x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution \\(u = 2x\\), which gives \\(du = 2 \\, dx\\) or \\(dx = du/2\\).

    "answer": "To solve the integral \\(\\int \\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x} \\, dx\\), we first simplify the integrand. Notice that the denominator can be factored as \\(x(x+5)\\).
