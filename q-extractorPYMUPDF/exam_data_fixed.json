    "answer": "To solve the integral \\(\\int \\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x} \\, dx\\), we first perform partial fraction decomposition on the integrand:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x} = \\frac{2x+5}{x(x+5)}\n\\]\n\nWe express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{x+5}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by the common denominator \\(x(x+5)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = A(x+5) + Bx\n\\]\n\nExpanding and equating coefficients, we have:\n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = Ax + 5A + Bx\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = (A + B)x + 5A\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we get the system of equations:\n\n1. \\(A + B = 2\\)\n2. \\(5A = 5\\)\n\nSolving these, we find \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 1\\).\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x+5} \\right) \\, dx = \\ln|x| + \\ln|x+5| + C = \\ln|x(x+5)| + C\n\\]\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{m}^{2m} \\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x} \\, dx = \\left[ \\ln|x(x+5)| \\right]_{m}^{2m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\ln|(2m)(2m+5)| - \\ln|m(m+5)|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\ln\\left(\\frac{4m^2 + 10m}{m^2 + 5m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe set this equal to \\(\\ln 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{4m^2 + 10m}{m^2 + 5m}\\right) = \\ln 3\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4m^2 + 10m}{m^2 + 5m} = 3\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n4m^2 + 10m = 3m^2 + 15m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - 5m = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(m\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nm(m - 5) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 0\\) or \\(m = 5\\).\n\nSince \\(m = 0\\) would make the integral undefined, the valid solution is:\n\n\\(m = 5\\)."

    "query": "The motion of an object is described by the equation dv/dt = -kv^2, where v is the velocity of the object in meters per second, t is the time in seconds, and k is a constant. The initial velocity of the object is u meters per second. Show that, after one second, the velocity of the object is v = u/(ku + 1). Give the result of any integration needed to solve this problem.",
    "type": "NCEA",
    "answer": "To solve the differential equation dv/dt = -kv^2, we separate variables and integrate:\n\n1. Separate variables:\n   dv/v^2 = -k dt\n\n2. Integrate both sides:\n   ∫(1/v^2) dv = ∫(-k) dt\n\n   This gives:\n   -1/v = -kt + C\n\n3. Use the initial condition to find C:\n   When t = 0, v = u:\n   -1/u = C\n\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   -1/v = -kt - 1/u\n\n4. Solve for v when t = 1:\n   -1/v = -k(1) - 1/u\n   -1/v = -k - 1/u\n\n   Rearrange to solve for v:\n   1/v = k + 1/u\n   v = 1/(k + 1/u)\n\n   Simplify:\n   v = u/(ku + 1)\n\nTherefore, after one second, the velocity of the object is v = u/(ku + 1)."

    "query": "The temperature of the coffee when it is poured is 65°C. After 2 minutes, its temperature is 62°C. Ben can drink the coffee when its temperature is 54°C. Solve the differential equation to find how long from when it was poured, that Ben has to wait before he can first drink the coffee.",
    "type": "NCEA",
    "answer": "To solve the differential equation, we assume the cooling of the coffee follows Newton's Law of Cooling, which can be expressed as:\n\ndT/dt = -k(T - T_env)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the coffee, T_env is the ambient temperature (assumed to be 18°C), and k is a positive constant.\n\nSeparating variables, we have:\n\n∫(1/(T - 18)) dT = -k ∫ dt\n\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n\nln |T - 18| = -kt + C\n\nAt t = 0, T = 65°C:\n\nln |65 - 18| = C = ln 47\n\nAt t = 2, T = 62°C:\n\nln |62 - 18| = -2k + ln 47\n\nSolving for k:\n\nln 44 = -2k + ln 47\n\nk = (ln 47 - ln 44) / 2 ≈ 0.03342\n\nNow, we find the time t when T = 54°C:\n\nln |54 - 18| = -0.03342t + ln 47\n\nln 36 = -0.03342t + ln 47\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (ln 47 - ln 36) / 0.03342 ≈ 8.08 minutes\n\nTherefore, Ben has to wait approximately 8.08 minutes before he can drink the coffee."
