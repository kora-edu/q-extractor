    "answer": "To find the maximum volume of the inscribed cylinder, we first express the volume of the cylinder in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet the radius of the cylinder be r and the height of the cylinder be h. The volume V of the cylinder is given by:\n\nV = pi * r^2 * h\n\nSince the cylinder is inscribed in the cone, the dimensions of the cylinder are constrained by the cone's dimensions. The cone's height is 3 meters, and its base radius is 1.5 meters. The relationship between the height and radius of the cone can be described by similar triangles.\n\nThe height of the cone at any point along its slant height is proportional to the radius at that point. Therefore, we have:\n\nh = 3 - (3/1.5) * r = 3 - 2r\n\nSubstitute this expression for h into the volume formula:\n\nV = pi * r^2 * (3 - 2r) = pi * (3r^2 - 2r^3)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we take the derivative of V with respect to r and set it to zero:\n\ndV/dr = pi * (6r - 6r^2)\n\nSet dV/dr = 0:\n\n6r - 6r^2 = 0\n\nFactor out 6r:\n\n6r(1 - r) = 0\n\nThis gives r = 0 or r = 1. Since r = 0 does not make sense in this context, we have r = 1.\n\nSubstitute r = 1 back into the expression for h:\n\nh = 3 - 2(1) = 1\n\nNow, substitute r = 1 and h = 1 into the volume formula:\n\nV = pi * (1)^2 * 1 = pi\n\nThus, the maximum volume of the cylinder is pi cubic meters."

The total distance from home to school is a fixed distance, say D kilometers.\n\n1. **Time on the path (H to P):**  \n   The time taken to travel from H to P is given by the formula:  \n   \\( t_1 = \\frac{x}{10} \\) hours.\n\n2. **Time across the park (P to S):**  \n   The remaining distance to school is \\( D - x \\).

However, since the derivative is constant, it indicates that the function is linear, and the minimum or maximum will occur at the endpoints of the interval. Therefore, we need to evaluate the travel time at the endpoints of the possible values of x (0 and D) to determine the minimum time.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since the derivative is constant, the minimum travel time will occur at one of the endpoints. Therefore, Megan should either start cutting across the park immediately (x = 0) or not cut across the park at all (x = D), depending on the specific values of D and the relative speeds."
