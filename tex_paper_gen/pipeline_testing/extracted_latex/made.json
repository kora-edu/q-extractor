\question[5][NCEA] The percentage of crops harvested depends on the number of days after planting and is modeled by the function:
\[ H(d) = -2d^3 + 18d^2 + 45d \]
where \( H \) is the percentage of crops harvested and \( d \) is the number of days since planting. Find the day when the rate of harvesting is maximized.

\question[5][NCEA] The graph below shows the function \( y = \cos(x/2) \) and the lines \( x = k \) and \( x = 2\pi \). Find the value of \( k \) so that the areas under the curve between \(x=0\) to \(x=k\) is half the area from \(x=0\) to \(x=2\pi\).
